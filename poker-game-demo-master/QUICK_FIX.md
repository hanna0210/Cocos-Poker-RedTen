# Connection Error Fix - Summary

## What Was Fixed

The client was trying to connect to external hardcoded IP addresses instead of localhost. I've fixed all the connection issues:

### Changes Made:

1. **`client/assets/scripts/Basic/hongshi.js`**
   - Changed server address from `ws://101.37.19.68:8011` to `ws://localhost:8011`
   - Added default IP address: `127.0.0.1`

2. **`client/assets/scripts/panel/Login.js`**
   - Changed WeChat login server to localhost
   - Changed IP detection server to localhost  
   - Disabled the IP detection call (since the IP server isn't running)
   - Added fallback to set default IP

## What You Need to Do Now

1. **Close the browser/preview** in Cocos Creator (if running)

2. **Clear the browser cache** or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

3. **Click the Play button** again in Cocos Creator

4. **Click the Login button** in the game

## Expected Result

You should no longer see connection errors in the F12 console. The client will now connect to:
- ✅ `ws://localhost:8011` for the game server
- ✅ Using default IP `127.0.0.1` (local development IP)

## If You Still See Errors

If you still get connection errors, make sure:
- The server is running on port 8011 (check with: `netstat -ano | findstr :8011`)
- MySQL database is set up (if the login process needs database access)
- No firewall is blocking localhost connections

## Optional: Start IP Detection Server (Not Required)

If you want the full IP detection feature, you can start the IP server:
```powershell
cd server\IpGet
node socket_io_ip_server.js
```

But this is NOT required for the game to work - it's just for getting your actual IP address.
