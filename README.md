It’s a 4‑player Chinese “Red Ten” (Hongshi) team game, not NLHE/Zoom/AOF/PLO.
Core traits: two red tens are special; “show red” phase; valid plays are singles, pairs, triples/quad bombs, straights, Joker bomb (114+214), Red‑Ten bomb (210+410); turn-based shedding; scoring by ranks of red‑ten side vs others.
